# Repository security advisory lifecycle

A repository advisory moves **`triage` → `draft` → `published`**. At `triage` or `draft` it can instead become **`closed`**.

```
private report ──► triage ──accept──► draft ──publish──► published
                     │                  │
                     └──────close───────┴──► closed
```

| State | How it gets there | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `triage` | A private vulnerability report (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories/reports`) | Private: maintainers, reporter, advisory collaborators |
| `draft` | A maintainer accepts a triage report ("Accept and open as draft"), or creates an advisory directly (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories`) | Private |
| `published` | A maintainer publishes a draft | Public, and reviewed for the GitHub Advisory Database |
| `closed` | A maintainer closes a triage report or draft that is not a vulnerability or will not be pursued | Private; `closed_at` is set, `published_at` stays `null` |
| `withdrawn` | Set by GitHub, not by the maintainer | Read-only; `withdrawn_at` is set |

## Reading the state

```bash
set -o pipefail
repo='OWNER/REPO'
ghsa='GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'
base="repos/$repo/security-advisories/$ghsa"
headers=(-H 'Accept: application/vnd.github+json' -H 'X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28')

gh api "$base" "${headers[@]}" --jq '{state, created_at, published_at, closed_at, withdrawn_at}'

# Pending private reports. The list filter accepts triage, draft, published, closed (not withdrawn).
gh api "repos/$repo/security-advisories?state=triage&per_page=100" "${headers[@]}" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {ghsa_id, summary, created_at}'
```

## Changing the state

`PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories/{ghsa_id}` accepts only `state` values `draft`, `closed`, and `published`. `triage` and `withdrawn` cannot be set. It requires a repository admin, security manager, or advisory collaborator, with a `repo` or `repository_advisories:write` token.

```bash
# triage -> draft (accept the report). Only when the user asks to accept it.
gh api --method PATCH "$base" "${headers[@]}" -f state=draft

# triage or draft -> closed. Only when the user asks to close; comment why first.
gh api --method PATCH "$base" "${headers[@]}" -f state=closed
```

- A `closed` advisory can be reopened with `state=draft` (verified on an advisory created as a draft; reopening a closed triage report was not tested).
- Setting `triage` or `withdrawn` returns `422`.
- Starting a temporary private fork does not move an advisory out of `triage` ([private fork workflow](security-advisory-private-fork-prs.md)).
- Before closing a report, add a comment explaining the decision ([comments workflow](security-advisory-comments.md)).
- Read the advisory back after each change and report the new `state`.

## Publishing is public and one-way

Never publish unless the user explicitly asks to publish that advisory. Publishing:

- Discloses the advisory to everyone and submits it for the GitHub Advisory Database, which can trigger Dependabot alerts. Add the patched versions first.
- Deletes the advisory's temporary private fork. Merge fix PRs upstream from the advisory page before publishing.
- Is not reversible by the maintainer. There is no unpublish: an advisory published in error can only be deleted by GitHub Support.

Check the user's intent and the advisory's `vulnerabilities[].patched_versions` before running `gh api --method PATCH "$base" "${headers[@]}" -f state=published`.

## Verification boundary

Verified on October 17, 2026 against the [REST reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/security-advisories/repository-advisories), the public [OpenAPI description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description), and the GitHub Docs pages on [managing private reports](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/managing-privately-reported-security-vulnerabilities) and [publishing](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory):

- The advisory schema's `state` enum is `published`, `closed`, `withdrawn`, `draft`, `triage`. The update schema's is `published`, `closed`, `draft`. The list filter's is `triage`, `draft`, `published`, `closed`.
- Private reports start in `triage`. Starting a private fork leaves them in `triage`. Accepting makes them a `draft`, and they can be closed from `triage`.
- Publishing deletes the temporary private fork. A published advisory can be deleted only through Support.

Live runs on `mcollina/skills` (October 2 and 17, 2026) with `gh` and an OAuth token carrying `repo`, on synthetic advisories:

- Created advisories start in `draft`; PATCH `state=closed` set `closed_at` and left `published_at: null`.
- PATCH `state=draft` on a `closed` advisory reopened it to `draft` and cleared `closed_at`.
- PATCH `state=triage` and `state=withdrawn` returned `422` with ``Invalid property /state: `triage` is not a possible value. Must be one of the following: published, closed, draft.``
- A repository admin cannot submit a private report to their own repository: `POST .../security-advisories/reports` returned `403 You are not authorized to report advisories in this repository via private vulnerability reporting`. Testing `triage` needs a report from a different account.

The `triage` → `draft` and `triage` → `closed` PATCHes and publishing were not live-tested. Never publish a test advisory.
